This page will walk you through all the steps necessary to access Cadence's software in whichever way works best for you. It'll guide you step-by-step through creating the necessary accounts, downloading the right software, accessing software remotely, and getting access to training courses on Cadence's Academic Network.

## Cadence Academic Network

### Creating an Account
To start, you'll want to go to the [CCIT page for Cadence](https://ccit.clemson.edu/services/software-hardware/software/cadence/). Here, complete the form linked under "Request a Cadence License". This will begin the process for CCIT to work with Cadence in creating you an account with access to the software downloads and training courses that's needed to work with the Cadence software.

Since the Cadence University Program partnership was rolled out to Clemson at the beginning of the Spring 2023 semester, it's possible that an account has already been created for your username, or that you created one yourself when emails were initially sent out regarding the partnership in January of 2023. It may be beneficial to attempt to login to the Cadence Support site or create an account there using your Clemson email address before requesting access on the CCIT page.

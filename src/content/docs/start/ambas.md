### What is the Ambassador Program?

The **Cadence Student Ambassador Program** is a course that you can take from the Cadence Academic Network that provides a wonderful introduction to Cadence as a company, career and internship opportunities for college students, design flow using Cadence tools, and an overview of the many different tools available to students from the Cadence Academic Network.

This course is a great way to get introduced to the different resources that Cadence has available for Clemson students, and I recommend that anyone interested in exploring Cadence tools and training courses should complete this quick program.

### How do I enroll?

From your training dashboard page on [support.cadence.com](https://support.cadence.com/apex/homePage?returnParam=true), there should be an option on the sidebar to select the "Cadence Ambassador Program". Clicking this will load the two training courses part of this program, the **All About Cadence for Student Ambassadors** course and the accompanying badge exam.

If you can't find the course here, you can try going directly to the [Student Ambassador info page](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/company/cadence-academic-network/students/ambassador.html) and clicking "Enroll Now!", which will redirect you to the training courses on your Cadence Support training dashboard. If you're still having trouble accessing or enrolling into the training course, you can [contact us](/other/contact) or [submit a support ticket](https://support.cadence.com/apex/COSCaseCreatePage?oMenu=Submit%20Case&pageName=COSCaseCreatePage) on the Cadence Support page to get additional help. The people that respond to these cases at Cadence are very responsive and helpful, and will generally get back to you regarding your issue within a day. Make sure to be descriptive regarding your issue when creating the support ticket!

The training itself for the Cadence Ambassador Program is very straightforward. The **All About Cadence for Student Ambassadors** course consists of videos in four different topics. The topics covered include a company overview of Cadence, career paths and opportunities available at Cadence, an overview of Cadence's technology, and an overview of the Cadence Academic Network and the tools available to students. The videos for each topic are only about 6 to 10 minutes, and it shouldn't take much more than 30 minutes to complete all of the content in this course. After completing this course, you can take the Student Ambassador Badge Exam to obtain your Student Ambassador badge and certificate. This quiz should only take about 5 minutes and contains information directly from the videos in the All About Cadence for Student Ambassadors course. You need a 90% or higher to pass the exam, and you can review and retake it as many times as you need to.

Once you've completed the training course and badge exam, you should now have your Cadence Student Ambassador certificate! Feel free to download this and share it on LinkedIn and add it to your resume - it's a great way to show companies and potential employers about your familiarity with Cadence and their powerful design tools. With your newfound knowledge, you can go ahead and explore more of the tools and training that Cadence has for students and start collecting more badges and certificates so you can expand your design skills. A great place to go from here would be to find a course plan from the [Cadence Learning Maps](https://www.cadence.com/content/dam/cadence-www/global/en_US/documents/training/learning-maps.pdf) that best suits your interests and enroll in your next course.

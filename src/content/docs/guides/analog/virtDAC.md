A Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) is an essential component in modern electronics, responsible for converting digital signals into analog ones. This allows devices such as audio systems, communication systems, and measurement instruments to interpret digital data in a form that can interact with the physical world. Among the various DAC architectures, the R-2R Ladder DAC stands out for its simplicity and scalability, making it a popular choice for applications requiring moderate resolution and performance.

This tutorial guides you through designing an 8-bit R-2R DAC schematic using Cadence Virtuoso. The design will leverage the gpdk 45nm technology node and focus on schematic capture, providing students with a hands-on introduction to Cadence's powerful design environment.

## Objective

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

Understand the fundamentals of the R-2R DAC architecture.

Gain hands-on experience with Cadence Virtuoso for schematic design.

Learn how to create libraries, cells and schematics

Learn basic navigation of the Virtuoso Environment

Simulate and verify the DAC's functionality using testbenches and performance metrics.

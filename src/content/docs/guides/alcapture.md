# Requirements
Access to OrCAD Capture software

No prior knowledge of circuit design is needed for this course

# General Notes

* Here is the link to the course.

* This course serves as an introductory class into using the Capture software, teaching actions such as opening projects, creating schematics, placing parts, routing, etc. Since it is an introduction, this course is fairly straightforward, though some later modules become slightly more complex. This course does offer a badge, so remember to take notes and pay close attention to the lectures. 

* **DO NOT** download the lab database into OneDrive (or any form of online storage), as this caused problems down the line for me archiving the project, etc. 

* I actually enrolled in the 22.1 version of the course but used the 17.4 version of the software, and I did not encounter any issues. Currently, we are using the 17.4 version of the software due to the 22.1 version not being fully licensed for Clemson students yet. 

* When the lab PDF tells you to save the project, and an error comes up when you do this, first check if the lab PDF says anything about potential errors coming up when saving the project. If it does, you are good to move on. If it does not, click on the error to see if you can fix it before moving on.

## Module 1
On the Module 1 page, click "Database Downloads" (also located at the bottom of the page) and save the folder "Lab Database" to a location on your computer. I recommend making this folder easy to access as you will be navigating to it a lot throughout the course. Right-click on this folder, most likely called "20210420-bimai-02" and click "Extract all". Also, open up the "Lab PDF" in a new tab. See below.

## 32-Bit Computer Processor

This implementation of a 32-bit computer processor was created by JB Bahrenburg using Cadence's Xcelium software as well as the Verisium Debug software.  The processor was written and simulated using the Verilog hardware description language but was not synthesized. This processor has a corresponding 32-bit instruction set with a 6-bit opcode. All of the input Verilog files were written and simulated using the cadence Xcelium software, an example of a running simulation can be seen in the photo to the right.

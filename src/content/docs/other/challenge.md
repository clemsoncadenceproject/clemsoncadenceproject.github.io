## Information

The start date of the 2026 Clemson Cadence Challenge is **February 20th**.

### Rules

**Competition Goal**
Complete as much Cadence training material as possible! The winner of the competition will have completed the greatest amount of Cadence training material.

Each learning module (see the [Training Courses](/start/training) page) awards the user with a digital cerificate. Upon completion, points corresponding to the expected time needed to complete the challenge will be awarded to the contestant.

For instance, submitting the badge for the Allegro Design Entry HDL Basics course, which is expected to take 8 hours, will net the user 8 points towads their overall score. These scores will be tracked over the next month, and the winner will have the highest score.

Courses with badges will appear on the Cadence learning map with the ribbon symbol shown below.
